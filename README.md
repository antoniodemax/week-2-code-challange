# Interactive Shopping List

## Description
In this challange there is a combination of array iterations,DOM manipulations and event handling that enable the creation of this interactive shopping list application.

## Project Setup
To make sure your repo runs, the following must be considered:
-Any chromium-based browser

## Technologies
-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT

## How it works
The user interacts with the application by adding, editing or deleting items.
The script updates the 'items' array accordingly.
The script saves the updated 'items' array to local storage using 'saveitems()'.
The script re-renders the shopping list using the 'renderlist()'.
The user sees the updated shopping List.

## Requirements
-Array: 
a javascript array must be maintained to store the shopping list items.

-DOM manipulation: 
The following should be considered;
  -HTML structure with a display of items and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
  -Javascript should be used to add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button.
  -List item should be updated to indicate the purchased items.(e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

-Event Handling:
Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
